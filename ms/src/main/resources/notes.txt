ACTUATOR: provides many endpoints to tract the application's performance.
we can see all the beans, we can also change the logging level by endpoints.
We can also shut-down the application.


PROFILES:
default file for config is application.properties
we can create more files for diff environment application-{profile-name}.properties
in application.properties
we need to write spring.profiles.active: profile-name
if any property is not available in mentioned profile file then it will be picked from
application.properties(default file)

If we want a bean to be created only when a particular profile is active, we can use @Profile()
